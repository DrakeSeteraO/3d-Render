# 3d-Render
Creates an image that depicts a 3D environment.
Use the convert to spherical cords file to write your xyz coordinates into spherical. It will save the data to a file with the name you selected then go to Spherical 3d render and give it the info such as the amount of pixels you want the image to be and then it will create a image using your previous file.
All of this was built from scratch so code might not be optimize, as well as if their are any errors you can email me at oakleypawsbusiness@gmail.com

Note: the camera's default starting angle is theta = pi/2 and thee = pi/2. Also theta is used for the angle in the xy plane. While Thee is the angle from the z axis to the xy plane.
